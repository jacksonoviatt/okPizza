        <h3>Okotoks Pizza:</h3>
        <p>
            They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs?
            This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Just my luck, no
            ice. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of
            here!
            Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Jaguar shark! So tell me -
            does it really exist? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power
            windows. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates
            Dinosaurs.
            I was part of something special. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. You're a very talented young
            man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Hey, take a look at the earthlings.
            Goodbye! God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.
            So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Eventually, you do plan to
            have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Life finds a way. Do you
            have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose.
